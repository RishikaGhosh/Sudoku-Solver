# Sudoku-Solver
## Introduction
This is a simple **JavaScript** Project which generates a random Sudoku Grid and solves it.

The project is hosted at:https://rishikaghosh.github.io/Sudoku-Solver/
## Main Idea
- <h3>The Setup of Sudoku</h3>
  1. i.In a classic Sudoku game, there is a 9 x 9 grid, with nine 9 x 9 subgrids.
  
  2. Some of the cells in the subgrid will be filled.
  
- <h3>The Task</h3>
     The task of the game is to complete the grid with digits 0 to 9 such that no number should not repeat in the:
     
       1. same row
       2. same column and 
       3. same sub-grid
 The main intention of this project is to solve a **randomly generated grid** using the concept of **Backtracking Algorithms**.
